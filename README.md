# Alice
Alice is a to be bot. She is aimed to provide a basic infrastructure for developers to create a bot with automated responses. Developers can integrate Alice in their project in stupidly easy ways. She will deliver implicit integration of bundles of services like weather, maps, day in history, jokes, fun facts with the help of third parties.

She is not mature today but of course you can say "Hi" to her. :)

Stay tuned!
